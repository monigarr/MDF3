android-image-filter
====================

some android image filters

in some filter, I use NDK to implement it

# Setup

- Install Android NDK and properly configure it: [http://goo.gl/koTCb](http://goo.gl/koTCb)
- Get a clean clone of this project, import the library in Ecliplse, click Project->Clean, then click Project->Build Project
to regenerate the library
- Then just add AndroidImageFilter as a dependency to your existing project.

# How to Use it

- It is dead simple, you can see magic in the following code:

```Java
  Bitmap newBitmap = BitmapFilter.changeStyle(originBitmap, BitmapFilter.BLUR_STYLE);
  imageView.setImageBitmap(newBitmap);
```

it is very simple, right? And you can see all filters in file [/src/cn/Ragnarok/BitmapFilter.java][3], it contains totally
17 kinds of filters now!

- Also, you can download the demo app from this [link][1]


If you have any question, please open an [issue][4] and show your code and the program ouput, thanks!
